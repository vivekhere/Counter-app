Lifecycle Hooks

- There are a few special methods that we can add to our components and react will 
  automatically call these methods.
- We refer to these methods as Lifecycle Hooks.
- So they allow us to hook into certain moments during the lifecycle of a component
  and do something.
- Our components go through various phases during their lifecycle.

MOUNT

- The first phase is the mounting phase.
- This is when an instance of a component is created and inserted into the DOM.
- In the mounting phase we have 3 lifecycle hooks
  - constructor
  - render
  - componentDidMount
- React will call these methods in order.

UPDATE

- The second phase is the update phase.
- This happens when the state or props of a component gets changed.
- In the update phase we have 2 lifecycle hooks
  - render
  - componentDidUpdate
- So whenever we change the state of our component or give it new props these methods
  are called in order.

UNMOUNT

- The last phase is the unmounting phase.
- This is when the component is removed from the DOM

- These lifecycle hooks are frequently used one's
- In the React documentation there are few more lifecycle hooks but they are 
  rarely used.
